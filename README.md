If you're reading this that means you're interested in what I and some friends are building with Peppubuild. The goal of this project is to empower `citizen developers` to create web applications with ease, while also giving `professional developers` the flexibility and speed they need for creating an application. Simply put, anyone can build a web based application and get them running in no time with Peppubuild. 

Teams can now build a functional MVP faster, utilising the already available team members. While this looks like a lot of promises, you can checkout the video below to see what a `citizen developer` can build with Peppubuild + Openai.

## üéÅ Why Peppubuild?

Imagine the code of your project in your hands? Imagine that you can do whatever you want with your project, host them anywhere and never worry about the safety of the platform it was built in? All of these while never bothering on [vendor-locked-in](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-vendor-lock-in/#:~:text=Vendor%20lock%2Din%20refers%20to,stuck%20with%20the%20original%20vendor.) and the scalability of your project.

This is all we've ever kept in mind as we build Peppubuild. We want a No-code application that provides all of the necessary flexibility and freedom for our users. Peppubuild is an alternative for Bubble and other tools, if you want to build an application using tools and frameworks that you are familiar with.

Here's what Peppubuild offers.

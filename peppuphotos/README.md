# PhotoDrive

PhotoDrive allows you to manage, share, and explore photos right from your Google Drive. PhotoDrive is API first, which means you can incorporate our API into your application to use the features listed below:
Built under the PeppuBuild ecosystem, PhotoDrive provides key functionalities like secure storage, photo sharing, privacy settings for photos and folder segregation, to enhance the way users interact with visual media.

## üöÄ Features
### Secure Storage
Leveraging Google's secure system, be sure that your memories are safe and secure. 

### Photo Sharing
Upload your picture to Google Drive and get a link that you can share across different platforms. URL is suitable for websites, markdown enabled platforms, and social media accounts.

### Collaboration and Privacy
Give people access to your photos as you wish or restrict them. You can mark photos `internal`, which means they won't showup for external use or you can mark them `external`, allowing them to be shown in public. With collaboration access, people you trust can delete and edit your photos.

### Educational Integration
Seamlessly integrate photos into educational tools like presentations or online learning modules.

### Folder Segregation
Arrange images from memorable events into one folder, so that all your images are arranged in one place. Share with your pals in one click.
